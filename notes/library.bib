abstract = {We present a survey on electronic voting schemes. We first summarize properties than such protocols should guarantee. In a second time we describe cryptographic primitives used in the context of electronic elections. Using these definitions we present a list of protocols and for each protocol we mention claimed, supposed, achieved or proven properties. When it is possible we also give existing or new attacks.},

abstract = {Human groups can perform extraordinary accurate estimations compared to individuals by simply using the mean, median or geometric mean of the individual estimations [Galton 1907, Surowiecki 2005, Page 2008]. However, this is true only for some tasks and in general these collective estimations show strong biases. The method fails also when allowing for social interactions, which makes the collective estimation worse as individuals tend to converge to the biased result [Lorenz et al. 2011]. Here we show that there is a bright side of this apparently negative impact of social interactions into collective intelligence. We found that some individuals resist the social influence and, when using the median of this subgroup, we can eliminate the bias of the wisdom of the full crowd. To find this subgroup of individuals more confident in their private estimations than in the social influence, we model individuals as estimators that combine private and social information with different relative weights [Perez-Escudero \& de Polavieja 2011, Arganda et al. 2012]. We then computed the geometric mean for increasingly smaller groups by eliminating those using in their estimations higher values of the social influence weight. The trend obtained in this procedure gives unbiased results, in contrast to the simpler method of computing the median of the complete group. Our results show that, while a simple operation like the mean, median or geometric mean of a group may not allow groups to make good estimations, a more complex operation taking into account individuality in the social dynamics can lead to a better collective intelligence.},

abstract = {PATRICIA is an algorithm which provides a flexible means of storing, indexing, and retrieving information in a large file, which is economical of index space and of reindexing time. It does not require rearrangement of text or index as new material is added. It requires a minimum restriction of format of text and of keys; it is extremely flexible in the variety of keys it will respond to. It retrieves information in response to keys furnished by the user with a quantity of computation which has a bound which depends linearly on the length of keys and the number of their proper occurrences and is otherwise independent of the size of the library. It has been implemented in several variations as FORTRAN programs for the CDC-3600, utilizing disk file storage of text. It has been applied to several large information-retrieval problems and will be applied to others.},

It is based on hierarchical finite state ma- chines. By the new extensions the development of cooper- ative multi agent behavior is supported through language elements which allow to conveniently specify how the state machines of multiple agents interact. Basic properties of XABSL are illustrated in direct comparison with Petri Net Plans and the COLBERT language using examples of basic robot behavior. More complex examples from robot soccer are used to illustrate the new extensions of XABSL. The complete system is available online on the XABSL website (http://www.xabsl.de).},

abstract = {We propose the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, solving a central open problem in cryptography. Such a scheme allows one to compute arbitrary functions over encrypted data without the decryption key – i.e., given encryptions E(m1), . . . , E(mt) of m1, . . . , mt, one can efficiently compute a compact ciphertext that encrypts f(m1,...,mt) for any effi- ciently computable function f. This problem was posed by Rivest et al. in 1978.$\backslash$nFully homomorphic encryption has numerous applications. For example, it enables private queries to a search engine – the user submits an encrypted query and the search engine computes a succinct encrypted answer without ever looking at the query in the clear. It also enables searching on encrypted data – a user stores encrypted files on a remote file server and can later have the server retrieve only files that (when decrypted) satisfy some boolean constraint, even though the server cannot decrypt the files on its own. More broadly, fully homomorphic encryption improves the efficiency of secure multiparty computation.$\backslash$nOur construction begins with a somewhat homomorphic “boostrappable” encryption scheme that works when the function f is the scheme’s own decryption function. We then show how, through recursive self-embedding, bootstrappable encryption gives fully homo- morphic encryption. The construction makes use of hard problems on ideal lattices.},
